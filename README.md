I created Dog Gallery, a service that allows users to curate a grid of dog images from random. Each shuffle gives you nine random dogs; click on the images to save them. When you're satisfied, you can export the grid to png.

I used the Dog API, an API for images of dogs. The most common endpoint is https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random Fetch!
 
I spent less than an hour. The stages were: populate a 3x3 grid using API call > shuffle button > allow users to save images from re-shuffle by clicking > export button. Each stage, barring minor UI tweaks, was functional.
